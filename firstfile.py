Let's set up a few workflows:
1. In the repository you created above. Setup a simple GitOps workflow that comments a
raised issue as 'stale' after 1 day and closes the issue after 2 days. Send your repo on
the channel so we can raise issues!
2. Create a workflow that :
Runs on an Ubuntu image.
Prints:
The OS name.
The list of files in the repository.
Any other unique value you can think of.
